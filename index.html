Some students took up the task (it was optional), and produced outstanding presentations on topics such as the complex exponential function, fractional derivatives, and even topics outside of calculus/analysis, like information theory. I was left wondering, “if only the class could have more of this kind of work”.</p><p>This year, I am blessed to be working to give students this opportunity. At the start of the year I began work on implementing a Quarterly Project. The following excerpt from a document given to students sums up the project:</p><i><p>“The joy of mathematics is in working on an open ended problem or task for a considerable amount of time, and finally cracking it. We want to offer you all the chance to creatively apply the content of each quarter to an exploration project where you can contribute something that will provide you a new perspective. This might sound ambitious, but there’s simply so many interesting applications and problems in calculus that we can’t run out of them ... </p><p>Students will work in groups of no larger than four to complete one of the project options over the course of a few weeks. Depending on the type of project, students may decide to work separately then come together to compare and contrast their findings, or they spend the entire time working together. We expect that each member of the group contributes something meaningful to the final project, because we want everyone to gain the experience of discovery in math.</p><p>Each project group will be require to submit one write-up detailing the results of their project. The contents of this write-up will vary, but it should take the form of a short (no more than a few page long) paper. ”</p></i><p>I had high hopes for the students, given their success on initial assessments in the first few weeks of class. Then on October 4th, the students broke into groups of four and began working. From the outset, I was amazed with their work.</p><p>The following are two write-ups from two groups that I especially enjoyed. The two problems they tackled were:</p><ul><li>The derivative of the area of a circle gives its circumference. But the derivative of the area of a square (with a certain choice of variable) will not be its perimeter. What are the conditions we need for choosing the variable to allow the shape to have the desired property? Are there shapes with no correct choice?</li></ul><p>
The group gave a sufficient criteria to answer the first question, and answered the latter in the negative given assumptions they made.</p><ul><li>Given a description of two disjoint sections of a roller coaster track, how can we design a curve to connect the two? What exactly would we want this curve to be like?</li></ul><p>
The second group wonderfully invented many different curves that work well, and discussed various observations they made.</p><p>Linked below are both write-ups.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdCNr3PhQm4QvYD6GJdLxgnsyqUm_DKX/view?usp=sharing">Group 1</a>
