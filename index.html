I’ve enjoyed independent study for as long as I can remember, and have been in the GT program since last year. This year, I’m co-teaching AP Calculus BC with Mr. Bermel and bringing a new perspective to the class.</p><h2 id="about-this-website">About this website</h2><p>This website will be a place to gather all of the materials and work I produce this year, as well as a space where I can create posts about math topics that I think about and enjoy. I’ve chosen <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">Idyll</a>, a static website generator with support for interactive components using React. To be honest, I don’t know much about web development, but I’m excited to learn what it takes to produce a pretty website! If Idyll becomes too cumbersome to use or doesn’t suit my interests, I might try another platform.</p><p>Here are some of the specific things I hope to host on this website:</p><ol><li><strong>Lesson plans.</strong> <!-- -->Throughout the year, I’ll be creating and teaching certain lessons, sometimes corresponding to the standard curriculum taught by Mr. Bermel, and other times with deviations. I hope to take my favorite ones and package them neatly into blog posts.</li><li><strong>Publication of the projects.</strong> <!-- -->Perhaps what I’m most excited to get out of this year is seeing students work on group projects that I’ve designed. I hope to post their results and document my discussions with them.</li><li><strong>Posts on miscellaneous math topics.</strong> <!-- -->There are so many intriguing math topics and problems out there, but they don’t get enough visibility. They’re hidden away in textbooks or lecture notes. I hope to find topics I like and write about them, with the goal of presenting these topics to people who aren’t specialized in math but want to learn more about it.</li></ol><p>
